# HW3 - AI Course (810603105) ‚Äì Tool Condition Monitoring üõ†Ô∏è

This repository contains the full implementation of **Homework 3** for the Artificial Intelligence course, prepared by **Mehrbod Zarifi**.

üìö This project focuses on tool condition monitoring in a **milling machine** using **binary** and **multi-class classification** methods. A real-world industrial dataset was used for fault detection and diagnosis using machine learning.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Description

The objective of this project is to classify the health condition of a cutting tool in a milling machine based on five sensor-based features.

### üîç Workflow Breakdown

#### A. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Dataset inspection using `info()` and `describe()`
- Missing value analysis
- Correlation matrix for feature dependency analysis

#### B. Data Preprocessing
- Imputation using `mean()` and `mode()`
- Outlier removal via `z-score`
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`

#### C. Binary Classification (`Failure` vs `No Failure`)
- Models used:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Support Vector Machine (Linear & RBF)
- Addressed class imbalance using **SMOTE**
- Hyperparameter tuning for RBF-SVM using `GridSearchCV`
- Evaluation:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1
  - ROC Curve, AUC
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision-Recall Curve
  - Class-wise F1 score
  - Predicted vs Actual comparison plot

#### D. Multi-Class Classification (5 Failure Types)
- Models used:
  - Random Forest
  - SVM (One-vs-Rest)
  - SVM (One-vs-One)
- Hyperparameter tuning for:
  - Random Forest (`n_estimators`, `max_depth`)
  - SVM-RBF (`C`, `gamma`)
- Feature importance comparison using:
  - `feature_importances_` (Random Forest)
  - `coef_` (SVM OvR)
- Evaluation:
  - Accuracy, Macro Precision, Recall, F1
  - Hamming Loss, Log Loss
  - Multi-Class ROC and PR curves
  - Per-class F1 bar chart
