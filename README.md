# HW3 - AI Course (810603105) ‚Äì Tool Condition Monitoring üõ†Ô∏è

This repository contains the full implementation of **Homework 3** for the Artificial Intelligence course, prepared by **Mehrbod Zarifi**.

üìö This project focuses on **tool condition monitoring** in a milling machine using both **binary** and **multi-class classification** techniques. A real-world industrial dataset was used for fault detection and diagnosis through machine learning.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Description

The objective of this project is to classify the health status of a cutting tool in a milling machine based on five sensor-based numerical features.

## üîç Workflow Breakdown

### A. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Inspection of dataset using `info()` and `describe()`
- Analysis of missing values
- Correlation matrix to examine feature relationships

### B. Data Preprocessing
- Imputation of missing values using `mean()` and `mode()`
- Outlier removal using `z-score`
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`

### C. Binary Classification (`Failure` vs `No Failure`)
- **Models Used:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM) ‚Äì Linear & RBF Kernels
- **Techniques:**
  - SMOTE for handling class imbalance
  - Hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV` (RBF-SVM)
- **Evaluations:**
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
  - ROC Curve & AUC
  - Precision-Recall Curve
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Class-wise F1 Score
  - Predicted vs Actual comparison plot

### D. Multi-Class Classification (5 Failure Types)
- **Models Used:**
  - Random Forest
  - SVM with One-vs-Rest (OvR)
  - SVM with One-vs-One (OvO)
- **Tuning with GridSearchCV:**
  - Random Forest: `n_estimators`, `max_depth`
  - SVM (RBF): `C`, `gamma`
- **Feature Importance:**
  - `feature_importances_` from Random Forest
  - `coef_` from SVM OvR
- **Evaluations:**
  - Accuracy, Macro Precision, Recall, F1 Score
  - Hamming Loss and Log Loss
  - ROC and Precision-Recall Curves (per class)
  - F1 Score per Class (Bar Chart)
